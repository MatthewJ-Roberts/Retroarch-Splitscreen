# retroarch-splitscreen
A screen splitter for Retroarch - load two instances of Retroarch seamlessly and simultaneously to play with a friend!


I initially built this with the intention of being able to simultaneously load any two apps and run them side by side, hence the name "monitor-splitter". Decided to just make it Retroarch specific, so I named the repo to reflect that. Also, since this was just an idea I was playing around with, I didn't make this repo until the app was effectively done.
The commit history is very small because of this.
