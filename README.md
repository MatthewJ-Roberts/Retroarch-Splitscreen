# Retroarch Splitscreen
A screen splitter for Retroarch - load two instances of Retroarch seamlessly and simultaneously to play with a friend!

**WARNING: This was made for Retroarch, but can technically launch ANY .exe. Only Retroarch's functionality has been tested, and development for other tools/games is not realistic.**

Features:
1. Open multiple instances of Retroarch with views programmed for 2, 3, or 4 players
2. If playing with 2 players, use your preference of either a horizontal or vertical split

**Please note that this application isn't anywhere near advanced as something like Nucleus Coop - it won't create local multiplayer sessions out of online only games.** It's just used as a means to open multiple instances of Retroarch and handle sizing and placement automatically.

Use Cases:
1. Local Pokemon Soul Links
2. Local speedrun competitions
3. Playing two different games side-by-side
4. Anything else you can think of!

How to use:
1. Run "Retroarch Splitscreen.exe"
2. Select the split direction
3. Select the number of players
4. Press "Browse" and select the location of your Retroarch executable (default path: "C:\RetroArch-Win64\retroarch.exe")
5. Press "Launch Splitter"
6. Ensure you have at least 2 different controllers and configure them within the Retroarch instances (set the controller to "Port 1" in both instances, and set "Port 2" to "N/A" in both instances)
7. Repeat step 6 for however many controllers you have, ensuring each Retroarch instance has their dedicated controller assigned to "Port 1"
8. Done!
